# Home Assistant net4home Integration

This repository contains the custom component for integrating net4home devices with Home Assistant.
The net4home integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect to net4home hardware devices.

## Prerequisites 

The integration requires one net4home Bus connector.
Each connection to a Bus connector is represented in Home Assistant as a **hub** device. After the hub is connected, net4home modules will appear as child devices. Entities are created based on the reported device type.
The `net4home` integration allows connections to more than one Bus connector. For each connector, a new integration entry needs to be created.

## Features

- Auto-discovery via Zeroconf
- Manual configuration (host, port, bus password, MI, OBJADR)
- Binary sensors (contact, motion, etc.)
- Localization support in English, German and Spanish

## Installation

To add the net4home integration to your Home Assistant instance, use this My button:

If the above My button doesnâ€™t work, you can also perform the following steps manually:
1. Copy the `net4home` folder into your Home Assistant configuration directory under `custom_components/`:

## Configuration

The net4home Bus connector can be auto-discovered by Home Assistant. If an instance was found, it will be shown as Discovered. You can then set it up right away.

## Supported device types 

- Binary_sensor
- Climate
- Cover
- Light
- Scene
- Sensor
- Switch

> The implemented platforms do not cover the whole functionality of

> used in automation scripts or for the template platforms.

## Setting up devices and entites

The `net4home` hardware modules are represented by Home Assistant _devices_. The periphery of each `net4home` module is represented by Home Assistant _entities_. Peripheries are, for example, the output ports, relays, and variables of a module.
